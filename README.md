# Tic Tac Toe Project

Tic-Tac-Toe Game Application In Ruby

> In this project, it is assigned for us to create a Tic Tac Toe game using only Ruby to increase our knowledge on the OOP concepts. 
This project was split in 4 milestones, which were:
- Setting up the project
- Designing the user interface
- Creating the game logic
- Writing the game instructions

> The main goal of this project is to asure I master the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.
## Demonstration

## Screenshot


## Built With
- Ruby
- Rubocop

## Prerequisites

- Browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any other browser)

## Setup
- Open Terminal

- Run git clone https://github.com/happiguru/tic-tac-toe/tree/game_logic
- Run `cd tic-tac-toe`
- Run `ruby bin/main`


## Game instructions
  The player has the option to play or to exit. If the player decides to play, these steps follow:
- Both players choose their names to play against each other
- A 3x3 grid is displayed on the terminal and the first player chooses a number to place his symbol on that number's position
- The players take turns in order to try to make an uninterrupted row, column or diagonal.
- The player which does that first wins!
- If all spaces are chosen and there is no winner, it is considered a draw
- On both situations above, there is the option to restart the game
- Have fun!
